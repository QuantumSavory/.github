# Bug Bounties

The QuantumSavory open source organization is continuously running bounties for bug fixes and enhancements to the tools we are developing. 
The goal of this program is three-fold: building community; providing opportunities for novices; creating better software.

To see all currently available bug bounties use [the organization's search page](https://github.com/search?q=org%3AQuantumSavory+label%3A%22bug+bounty%22&type=issues) or look directly at the issue trackers of the underlying projects. Here is a non-exhaustive list:

- [`QuantumSavory.jl`](https://github.com/QuantumSavory/QuantumSavory.jl/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abounty%3A400)
- [`QuantumClifford.jl`](https://github.com/QuantumSavory/QuantumClifford.jl/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abounty%3A400)
- [`QuantumSymbolics.jl`](https://github.com/QuantumSavory/QuantumSymbolics.jl/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abounty%3A400)

You can always propose your own funded project, if you would like to contribute something of value that is not yet covered by an official bounty. Just contact us, e.g. by posting on the issue tracker or in the "quantum" topic on the [julia discourse forum](https://discourse.julialang.org/).

All bounty projects are expected to be polished, tested, and documented -- not simply a code dump. We will help you and guide you during the polishing steps, especially if you are a new contributor.

The Funding for these bounties comes from the National Science Foundation and from the NSF Center for Quantum Networks.
The payouts are managed by the NumFOCUS foundation and processed in bulk once every two months.
If you live in a country in which NumFOCUS can make payments, you can participate in this bounty program.
