### Bug bounty logistic details

To claim exclusive time to work on this bounty either post a comment here or message [skrastanov@umass.edu](mailto:skrastanov@umass.edu) with:

- your name
- github username
- **(optional)** a brief list of previous pertinent projects you have engaged in

Currently the project is claimed by `no one` until `...`.

If you want to, you can work on this project without making a claim, however claims are encouraged to give you and other contributors peace of mind. Whoever has made a claim takes precedence when solutions are considered.

You can always propose your own funded project, if you would like to contribute something of value that is not yet covered by an official bounty.

# Project: "Update This Title To The Project Title" [add the award amount in square brackets]

*Here give description of the project.*

**Reviewer**: Who will review the work

**Duration**: Expected duration of the project (except potential review overhead)

**Publication**: In the next 2 years we plan to release a paper in a selective journal about this software. Contributing to this issue would deserve a co-authorship status on such a paper (if the contributor so desires)

#### Payout procedure:

The Funding for these bounties comes from the National Science Foundation and from the NSF Center for Quantum Networks.
The payouts are managed by the NumFOCUS foundation and processed in bulk once every two months.
