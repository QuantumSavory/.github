If you want to submit an unfinished piece of work in order to get comments and discuss, please mark the pull request as a draft and ping the repository maintainer.

Before considering your pull request ready for review and merging make sure that all of the below are completed:

- The code is properly formatted and commented.
- Substantial new functionality is documented within the docs.
- All new functionality is tested.
- All of the automated tests on github pass.

Before merging, all changes and new functionality should be marked in the CHANGELOG file, but feel free to just leave your CHANGELOG notes in the PR description, to avoid merge conflicts with other requests modifying that file. The maintainer will add these CHANGELOG notes for you if you do so.
